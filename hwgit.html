      <h2>What is Docker</h2>
      <p>Dockers makes it easier to diploy and run applications using containers. Containers allow one to to store an application and all of its parts
      as one package. Think of this as a contained ecosystem with everything it needs to sustain it self. Additionally, Docker is open source like other
      things you might be familiar with like R or Python. This allows anyone to contribute to Docker and extend it's functionality. For these reasons
      Dockers allows business to deploy applications faster potentially incrasing revenue or efficiency.
